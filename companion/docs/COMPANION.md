# Quadra companion: user guide

The companion is the desktop app for the Quadra knob. It changes the knob's settings and app
profiles from the computer. This guide is for someone using the app. For building it, see the
[companion README](../README.md); for the protocol and the firmware side, see
[FIRMWARE.md](../../NanoDepsidf/docs/FIRMWARE.md) §10.

The screenshots here are taken in demo mode (a simulated knob), so some values differ from a
real device.

## 1. Connecting

<img src="fig-connection.svg" width="880" alt="The app and the web page share one UI and reach the knob over its vendor HID interface">

There are two ways to run the companion, with the same screens:

| | Quadra app | Web page |
|---|---|---|
| Runs in | Its own window (macOS) | Chrome or Edge |
| Connecting | Finds the knob itself, and again after a replug; over Wi-Fi once paired | Click **Connect** once and pick the knob; automatic after that |
| Safari, Firefox | – | Not supported (no WebHID): the page says **No USB access here** |

**Over Wi-Fi (the app):** once the knob is on your network (**Device › Wi-Fi**), press
**Pair this app** there while it's on USB. From then on, with no cable in, the app reaches it
over Wi-Fi (found by name, `quadra-xxxx.local`); plug a cable in and it moves back to USB within
a few seconds. Pairing hands the app the knob's key: nothing else on the network can read,
forge or replay what goes between them. The network, the password and the key itself change
over USB only.

Neither needs a driver, and macOS doesn't ask for Input Monitoring permission.

The knob has to start in **HID** mode, which is the normal one. In serial mode (used for
flashing) the companion can't see it.

<img src="app-not-connected.png" width="720" alt="The companion with no knob: Connect your Quadra">

Until a knob answers, the page says what to do, and the knob's picture in the sidebar is dimmed.

## 2. The window

<img src="fig-window.svg" width="880" alt="Map of the window: the knob, the pages, where you are, one save, and the page">

1. **Your knob:** its picture, with what its main screen shows now (the profile in use, or the
   mode), its name and how it's connected (USB or Wi-Fi, and the firmware version).
2. **The pages,** in three groups:
   - **Knob:** **Mode** (what the knob sends) and **Haptics** (how it feels).
   - **App profiles:** one entry per profile on the knob, and **New profile**. A green ring round
     an icon marks the profile in use.
   - **Setup:** **Look**, **Device** and **System info**.
3. **Where you are.**
4. **One save** for everything: settings, the lights and app profiles. See
   [Live and saved](#3-live-and-saved).
5. **The page.** Some pages have tabs. Amber marks the choice that's on; a small amber dot marks
   a change that's live on the knob but not saved yet (on a card, and on its page in the sidebar).

The app doesn't mirror the knob's screen or its lights live: the knob itself shows that.

## 3. Live and saved

<img src="fig-live-save.svg" width="880" alt="A change goes live on the knob at once; Save to knob stores it; Revert returns to what is stored">

Every change goes to the knob at once, so you feel it while you adjust it. It is stored only
when you save:

- **Save to knob** (top right) stores everything that isn't stored yet. Pressing **F2** in the
  knob's own menu stores the settings and the lights.
- The amber label beside it says how many things aren't saved, and where. Click it for the
  list, with a **Revert** for each:

  <img src="app-unsaved.png" width="720" alt="The list of what isn't saved: Settings (Haptics) and Figma, each with Revert; Revert all and Save to knob">

  Settings and the lights revert together (the knob keeps them as one). Each app profile
  reverts on its own.
- **Revert all** returns everything to what's stored.
- A change that isn't saved is lost when the knob loses power.

A few things are stored on the knob as soon as you set them, with no Save: the idle word, the
music cover style, the clock, and Wi-Fi. Their pages say so.

## 4. Mode

<img src="app-mode.png" width="720" alt="Mode: App, Mouse, Keys and MIDI; the profile in use; Edit and Duplicate">

**Mode** is what the knob sends to the computer:

| Mode | What the knob does |
|---|---|
| **App** | Follows an app profile |
| **Mouse** | Scroll wheel |
| **Keys** | Keyboard keys |
| **MIDI** | Stores a MIDI channel only; no MIDI is sent yet |

In **App** mode, **Profile in use** lists the profiles on the knob with the icons the knob
draws (their black is see-through, as on the knob); click one to use it (on the knob: F4 menu › Profiles). Under each name is where it comes
from:

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Built-in** | Part of the firmware, unchanged |
| **Built-in, changed** | A built-in with a stored copy of your edits |
| **Yours** | A profile you made, stored on the knob |
| **Not saved** | Has edits that are live but not stored |

**Edit** opens the profile in use, **Duplicate** makes a copy of it, and **New profile** makes an
empty one; both new ones open straight away, in use. The knob holds up to 16 profiles.

In **Mouse** and **Keys**, the page shows which haptic profile the knob uses in that mode; each
mode keeps its own:

<img src="app-mode-mouse.png" width="720" alt="Mode with Mouse: the haptic profile for Mouse">

## 5. Haptics

<img src="app-haptics.png" width="720" alt="Haptics: the five haptic profiles, the feel cards and the tuning sliders">

A **haptic profile** is a complete feel: how far apart the steps are, how a step pushes back,
and how strongly. There are five, and everything uses them: the modes, and each input of each
app profile. Tune one here and it changes everywhere it's used.

| Haptic profile | Steps per turn |
|---|---|
| **Wide** | 8 |
| **Coarse** | 12 |
| **Medium** | 24 |
| **Fine** | 36 |
| **Smooth** | None: a smooth drag |

Pick one to tune it; the knob takes it on while you do.

**Feel** is how a step pushes back. Each feel keeps its own tuning, so switching feel shows that
feel's values. Wide, Coarse, Medium and Fine offer Saw and Sine; Smooth is always Viscose.

| Feel | What it's like |
|---|---|
| **Saw** | A crisp snap into each step |
| **Sine** | A round bump |
| **Viscose** | A smooth drag, with no steps (Smooth only) |

**Tune** has five sliders for that haptic profile and feel. Drag one, scroll over it, use the
arrow keys, or type a value in its box. The knob only accepts values inside a safe range for
that profile and feel, so the sliders' ranges change with them.

| Slider | What it sets |
|---|---|
| **Snap** | How firmly a step holds (kp). Not used in Viscose |
| **Damp** | How much the knob resists fast turning (kd) |
| **Shape** | How late the pull of a step rises. At 0% it grows evenly from the centre; higher values make the centre softer and the rise near the next step steeper. Saw only |
| **Click volume** | The audio click. In Viscose it is off by default and goes up to 20% |
| **Click pitch** | The click's pitch. In Viscose, 1× to 2× |

A slider that doesn't apply in the current feel is greyed out and shows `—`.

**Reset … to factory** puts the chosen haptic profile back to its original feel and values. Like
any change it is live at once and stored when you save. On the knob, holding F2 for 1.5 seconds
on the Haptics screen does the same.

## 6. App profiles

<img src="app-profile-editor.png" width="720" alt="A profile's General tab: name, icon, key labels, the main screen, and a preview of the knob's screen">

Click a profile in the sidebar to open it. Every profile can be edited, the built-in ones too.
The header shows its state: **In use** (or a **Use on the knob** button), where it comes from,
and **Live, not saved** while it has unsaved edits. An edit goes to the knob a moment after you
make it, so you can try it straight away; the line under the name says when it's sent, or what
the knob refused and why.

<img src="fig-profile-layers.svg" width="880" alt="A profile's layers: live edit over stored copy over built-in, with Save to knob, Revert and Reset to default">

A profile has four tabs.

**General:**

| Field | What it is |
|---|---|
| **Name** | Up to 15 characters |
| **Icon** | **Import image…** takes any picture and makes the 48 px and 24 px icons the knob draws |
| **Key labels** | The words under F1–F4 on the knob's screen, up to 7 characters each |
| **Main screen** | The middle of the knob's screen: the **Action name**, or a **3D shape** (cube, pyramid or octa, in three styles) that moves as you turn |

**On the knob** shows the main screen drawn the way the knob draws it. At the bottom,
**Reset to default** (a changed built-in) deletes your stored copy, so the original shows again;
**Delete profile** (one of your own) removes it from the knob. Both ask once more before they act.

The other tabs: [Knob & keys](#7-knob-and-keys), [Command wheel](#8-command-wheel) and
[Macros](#9-macros).

## 7. Knob and keys

<img src="app-editor-keys.png" width="720" alt="Knob & keys: the five inputs in a row, F1 open: Keys, the shortcuts for each way, its haptic profile Coarse, and a quick tap">

There are five inputs: the **Knob** turned by itself, and the knob turned while holding **F1**,
**F2**, **F3** or **F4**. The row at the top shows what each one does and its haptic profile;
click one to set it up below. Each is set to one of these:

| Does | What it sends | Its settings |
|---|---|---|
| **Off** | Nothing | – |
| **Scroll** | The scroll wheel | Modifier keys held, direction |
| **Drag** | A mouse drag | Mouse button, modifier keys, axis, speed, direction |
| **Keys** | One shortcut per step | One for turning right, one for turning left |
| **Tap** | A shortcut or a macro on a press (F1–F3) | The shortcut, or the macro |
| **Wheel menu** | Opens the command wheel (F1–F3) | Its rings are on the Command wheel tab |
| **Media** | Media keys: play / pause, next, previous, volume, mute (knob, F1–F3) | The knob: one for each way and the volume step (Fine = a quarter step on a Mac); a key: the one it sends on press |

- **Name on screen** is what the knob's screen shows while that input is in use.
- **Haptic profile** is how that input feels: **Mode default** (the App mode's own), or one of
  the five haptic profiles. That's the only haptic choice per input: the feel and the strength
  come from the haptic profile, tuned once under [Haptics](#5-haptics). A wheel menu needs
  steps, so it can't use Smooth.
- **Quick tap** (F1–F3) is a shortcut or a macro sent when you press and let go without turning.
  It works alongside the turning action of the same key.
- **F4** has no press actions: held still, it opens the knob's menu.

To set a shortcut, click its field and press the keys. Hover over it for the ⌃ ⌥ ⇧ ⌘ buttons,
for shortcuts the system keeps to itself (⌘Q, ⌘Tab); × clears it.

## 8. Command wheel

<img src="app-editor-wheel.png" width="720" alt="Command wheel: the ring LAYOUT with three commands, and the command search settings">

The command wheel appears on the knob while you hold a key set to **Wheel menu**: turn to pick
a command, let go to run it. The tab says which key opens it.

- A **ring** is a group of commands, with a **Name**, a short **Tab** label, and a **Jump key**
  (F1–F4) that jumps to it while the wheel is open. Up to 8 rings; pick one on the left to edit it.
- A **command** has a name and runs one of:
  - **Shortcut:** a key combination.
  - **Search:** text typed into the app's own command search. **Command search** below sets the
    shortcut that opens the search and how long to wait for it and for its results.
  - **Macro:** one of the profile's macros.
- ↑ and ↓ reorder commands, × deletes one. Up to 32 commands in a ring.
- A **Card** tag means the command has an animated illustration on the knob; **Value** means it
  sets a number afterwards. Both are kept as they are, and can't be edited here yet.

## 9. Macros

<img src="app-editor-macros.png" width="720" alt="Macros: EXPORT PNG with a key, a pause, a text and a key step, and Record">

A macro is a list of steps the knob types by itself. It is stored on the knob, so it works
with no app running.

| Step | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Key** | Presses one shortcut |
| **Text** | Types text (plain ASCII, up to 120 characters, as US keys) |
| **Pause** | Waits, up to 10 seconds |

Build a macro with **+ Key**, **+ Text** and **+ Pause**, or record one:

1. Choose **Keys only**, or **With timing** to keep the pauses between your key presses.
2. Click **Record** and type.
3. Click **Stop**.

Shortcuts the system takes first (⌘Q, ⌘Tab) can't be recorded. Add those with **+ Key**.

To use a macro, set a key to **Tap** and choose **Macro**, set a key's **Quick tap** to
**Macro**, or set a command to **Macro**. The list says how often each macro is used. Renaming a
macro updates the places that use it; deleting it clears them.

A profile holds up to 16 macros of up to 64 steps each. The knob types about 50 keys a second.

## 10. Look

Three tabs: **Lights**, **Screen & music** and **Clock**. Lights and the clock need firmware with
the extensions (2.0 and later).

<img src="app-look.png" width="720" alt="Look, Lights: color from the app or custom, hue and saturation, the effects, speed and brightness">

**Lights:**

| Setting | What it sets |
|---|---|
| **Color** | The ring and the keys: **From the app** (the profile's colours, or the album cover's while music plays) or **Custom**, with your own **Hue** and **Saturation** |
| **Effect** | At rest: Gradient, Solid, Breathe, Spin, Rainbow or Off; **Speed** for the moving ones; **Brightness** within the USB power budget |

The lights are live on the knob while you change them and kept by **Save to knob** (or F2 on
the knob's own Lights screen). Changes made on the knob show up here within a second.

<img src="app-look-screen.png" width="720" alt="Look, Screen & music: the idle word, the music cover styles, and screen rotation">

**Screen & music:**

| Setting | What it sets |
|---|---|
| **Idle word** | The word on the loading and idle screens, up to 12 characters (lowercase draws as small capitals). **Back to QUADRA** restores it. Stored on the knob as soon as you press **Set** |
| **Music cover** | How the Music app shows the cover while something plays: **Flat** (full screen), **Record** (the glass is a spinning record, the cover its label), **Slide** (a sleeve the record slides out of) or **Bleed** (a big sleeve that slides off the glass). Stored on the knob at once. On the knob, a tap of F4 on the now-playing screen steps through them (extensions v8 and later) |
| **Screen rotation** | 0, 90, 180 or 270 degrees. Kept by Save to knob |

<img src="app-look-clock.png" width="720" alt="Look, Clock: 24-hour, seconds and date on; local time; Tokyo and New York as world zones">

**Clock** (the Clock app, extensions v5 and later): what it shows — **24-hour**, **Seconds**,
**Date**, and **Seconds on the LED ring** — and up to four world zones besides the local time,
which is this computer's (the Mac service sends the time and the zone; with Wi-Fi on, the knob
also sets its clock from the internet). Each zone follows its own daylight-saving rules. In the
Clock app on the knob, turning steps through the zones; F1 switches 12 / 24 hours, F2 the
seconds, F3 the date. Stored on the knob as you change them.

## 11. Device

<img src="app-device.png" width="720" alt="Device, General: Mac or PC, HID or serial at start, and the firmware details">

**General:**

| Setting | What it sets |
|---|---|
| **Computer** | The computer on the other end. On **PC**, shortcuts written with ⌘ are sent with Ctrl |
| **Starts in** | **HID** for normal use, **Serial** for flashing. Applies after a restart |
| **Firmware** | Version, build date, protocol version, extensions, number of app profiles, and the link in use (USB, Wi-Fi or WebHID) |

**Take care with Starts in:** once the knob restarts in serial mode, the companion can't reach
it. Switch back in the knob's own menu: **BOOT MODE › USB MODE › HID**, then restart.

<img src="app-device-wifi.png" width="720" alt="Device, Wi-Fi: connected to STUDIO, the knob's address, signal and name; network, password, Connect and Turn Wi-Fi off">

**Wi-Fi** (firmware with Wi-Fi, extensions v4 and later): the network the knob joins (set over
USB; the password stays on the knob) and its address, then **This app over Wi-Fi** (the app
only, not the web page): **Pair this app** (see [Connecting](#1-connecting)), **New key** (asks
once more: every other paired computer has to pair again) and **Forget**.

## 12. System info

<img src="app-sys-info.png" width="720" alt="System info: power, heat, CPU and system tiles with gauges and the last minute">

Four tiles, each with a gauge, its numbers, and a chart of the last minute. A tick on a gauge
marks the peak, and **Reset peaks** clears the peaks. Amber numbers are peaks, or counters that
should be zero and aren't.

| Tile | What it shows |
|---|---|
| **Power** | Current drawn, against what the USB port offers; split into motor, LEDs and board. It's an estimate: the board can't measure current |
| **Heat** | Chip temperature, and the motor coil's current and heating |
| **CPU** | Load on each core. Core 0 runs only the control loop: its rate, work time, jitter, spikes and missed ticks |
| **System** | Uptime, free memory, and counters for dropped HID reports, audio gaps and sensor errors |

The knob sends these numbers only while this page is open: it does a little work for each
report, so the app doesn't ask for them otherwise.

## 13. When something doesn't work

| What you see | What to do |
|---|---|
| **Looking for your Quadra** stays | Check the cable. Check the knob starts in HID mode (knob menu: BOOT MODE) |
| **No USB access here** (web page) | Open the page in Chrome or Edge, or use the app |
| **Connect your Quadra** (web page) | Click **Connect** and pick the knob; the browser asks once |
| A setting came back after a restart | It wasn't saved. Change it again and press **Save to knob** |
| An edit is refused, with a message under the profile's name | The message says which field: for example a name that's too long, or text that isn't plain ASCII |
| **New profile** and **Duplicate** are greyed out | The knob already holds 16 profiles. Delete one |
