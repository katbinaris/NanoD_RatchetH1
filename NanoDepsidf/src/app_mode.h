// APP mode (HID type "APP"): the knob and F1-F4 drive an application, as described by the
// active app profile (src/app_profiles/, chosen in the menu's PROFILE row). This file is the
// engine; it knows nothing about any particular app.
//
// Slots (app_profile.h): turning with no key held = the KNOB slot; holding F1/F2/F4 and
// turning = that key's slot; a TAP slot fires on press. Holding F4 ~0.7s without turning
// opens the menu in every profile. Output only starts once the knob actually moves, so a
// held key that never turns sends nothing -- that's what lets the long press mean "menu".
// The knob-alone slot starts by itself on the first movement and lets go once the knob
// rests (250ms).
//
// State, not events: the control task (Core 0) only records what the host *should* see --
// held mouse buttons + modifier, pending pointer travel and wheel steps, queued key taps --
// and usb_task.c keeps sending until the host matches. A report lost to a busy endpoint
// therefore can't leave a button or modifier stuck down (the first hardware test did exactly
// that with queued edge events). Buttons are debounced here (raw GPIO bounce fired several
// actions per press).

// One queued key tap. `wait_ticks` = pause after it (10ms ticks) -- a command-search macro
// waits for the search box to open and for results to appear.
