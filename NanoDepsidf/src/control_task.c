// control work (bidirectional holding confirmed by hand). This extends that into a bench
// validation: step through several target positions around a full revolution (not just
// holding wherever the rotor happened to start), measuring steady-state tracking accuracy
// at each, using a PD controller (P alone showed real but expected overshoot on a firm
// nudge -- D damps that). NOT the real haptic control program -- that's Phase 2b, gated on
// a joint design session.
//
// New risk closed-loop introduces that open-loop didn't have: a sign error in calibration
// (direction or offset) turns the controller into POSITIVE feedback -- it would push harder
// away from the target as error grows, instead of correcting toward it. Voltage is still
// capped the same way as every other test (see motor_config.h), so this isn't a new

// --- Haptic detent demo (BTN_A+BTN_B+BTN_D at boot) ---
// Nearest-grid-point linear ("sawtooth") detent profile: retarget every tick to whichever
// of the N evenly-spaced detents is nearest, then Vq = Kp*error - Kd*velocity. Force ramps
// UP linearly as you move away from a detent center, then INSTANTLY inverts sign at the
// midpoint between two detents -- the max-slope moment (the snap) happens exactly at the
// boundary, and the profile is gentlest exactly at rest (center).
//
// SECOND APPROACH after a sine-wave profile (Vq = -Kclick*sin(N*rel) - Kd*velocity)
// prototype: continuous, no target-flip discontinuity, but structurally backwards for a
// "click" -- sine's slope (local stiffness) is STEEPEST at the center (causing persistent
// oscillation there, worse the more detents/gain) and FLATTEST at the boundary (the
// opposite of a snap -- felt like "a bump" not a click, no matter how much Kp/Kd/filtering/
// loop-rate tuning was applied). This linear profile has the max-slope moment in the right
// place (the boundary) and is gentler at the exact point (center) that was ringing.
//
// FIRST tried this same linear approach even earlier, before most of the infrastructure
// improvements landed (10kHz loop, rate-correct velocity filter, 0.5A current cap, faster
// haptic-only slew, legacy-inspired velocity coasting) -- it was never fairly retested
// under today's conditions, only compared against sine under the old, weaker setup.

// damping "viscous fluid" feel noted below (Kp=HAPTIC_KP_MIN, Kd~0.055) falls straight out of
// those same two live-tunable knobs, no separate mode needed.
//

// alone flip the nearest-detent pick every tick, chattering between two targets.

// ramps up by HAPTIC_WALL_GAIN x Kp on top of the normal spring, starting from zero there so
// the force is continuous (no bump). No breakaway: the first version re-based after 1.6
// detents, which felt like a ratchet on hardware ("pushes back, then a noticeable skip"). The

// physical limit no amount of Kp/Kd retuning can work around. But legacy also does two
// things structurally different that ARE worth adopting without touching the current cap:
// (1) it zeroes the restoring torque entirely above a shaft-velocity threshold ("knob is
// smooth while rotating quickly by hand but snappy during fine adjust" -- their comment) --
// our -Kd*velocity term does the opposite, actively resisting fast motion, which reads as
// friction; (2) it has no explicit slew limit, relying on SimpleFOC's real current control
