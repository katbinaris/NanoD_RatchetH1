# Quadra pixel art: how it is made

This document is the rulebook for everything Quadra draws: the device's screens, the
companion app, and the screenshots in the docs. It is for contributors, and for Claude or any
other assistant working on the repo. Read it before adding or changing a screen, a sprite, an
icon, a command card or an animation, and follow it exactly. A change that breaks a rule here
will be asked to change.

Paths below are relative to `NanoDepsidf/` unless they start with `companion/`.

## 1. The rules

1. **Whole pixels only.** Every shape is made of axis-aligned, whole-pixel rectangles. No
   anti-aliasing, no blending, no sub-pixel positions, no smoothed lines or curves. A curve or
   a circle is a run of whole pixels.
2. **Black background, four colours.** White, grey, dark and amber (section 2). App icons are
   the only full-colour artwork. A new colour needs a reason good enough to change this
   document.
3. **Drawn from descriptions, not stored as pictures.** Screens, sprites, command cards and
   animations are code or data that describe shapes (a box here, a row there, a keyframe
   time), drawn at runtime. Do not add pre-rendered frames, sprite sheets or bitmaps for UI
   art. The two exceptions are the app icons (section 7) and the font (section 5), and both
   are generated from source files by tools in the repo.
4. **Scale by whole numbers.** 2×, 3× and 4× repeat each pixel. A 1.5× version of a sprite is
   a separate hand-drawn sprite (the `_M` sprites), never a resample.
5. **Pixels are shared by firmware and host.** All device drawing goes through `ui_gfx.cpp`,
   which also compiles on the computer for the preview tool (section 11). Do not draw with
   LovyanGFX calls directly in a screen; add a primitive to `ui_gfx` if one is missing.
6. **Time, not frame counts.** Animations are functions of elapsed milliseconds
   (section 9), so they look the same at any frame rate.

## 2. Palette

Defined in `src/ui_gfx.hpp` (firmware) and `companion/src/ui/kit.ts` (`C`).

| Name | RGB | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| BLACK | `#000000` | Background. Also "transparent" in icons |
| WHITE | `#FFFFFF` | Values, active content |
| GREY | `#6E6E6E` | Labels, hints, inactive items, muted settings |
| DARK | `#3A3A3A` | Rules, empty parts of bars and gauges, outlines |
| AMBER | `#FFC94D` | Focus, editing, pressed keys, unsaved changes, peaks and warnings |

The keycap sprite has its own shading (`KEY_FACE`, `KEY_SIDE`, `KEY_OFF_FACE`,
`KEY_OFF_SIDE`). Those belong to the keycap only.

Each app also has three **accent colours**, used by the idle screen and the LEDs: the
profile's `plasma_heat`, or failing that the three most common colours of its 48×48 icon
(`src/app_colors.c`). Accents never appear in menus or general UI.

## 3. The canvas

- The display is a round 240×240 panel. Everything is drawn into one full-screen sprite and
  pushed whole. The centre is `ui::CX`, `ui::CY` = (120, 120).
- The corners are outside the glass. Keep content inside the circle; text and rows near the
  top and bottom must be narrower than the circle is at that height.
- Screens are laid out in absolute pixel coordinates. Existing screens in
  `src/ui_screens.cpp` are the reference for spacing: a header at the top, content in the
  middle column (about x 85 to 155 is free on the Haptics ring), hints and the key legend at
  the bottom.

## 4. Drawing primitives

From `src/ui_gfx.hpp`. Use these; they are the only things that touch the frame.

| Primitive | Draws |
|---|---|
| `rect(x, y, w, h, c)` | A filled rectangle |
| `cut(x, y, w, h, c)` | A filled rectangle with its four corner pixels cut |
| `frame_box(x, y, w, h, c)` | A 1px outline with the corners cut |
| `disc(cx, cy, r, c)` | A filled circle in whole pixels |
| `sprite(s, x, y, c, scale)` | A 1-bit sprite (section 6) in one colour |
| `image565(x, y, w, h, data, brightness, scale)` | A full-colour icon; black pixels are skipped |
| `text(s, x, y, c, scale, align)` | Text (section 5) |
| `plot_curve(...)` / `wave_y(...)` | The haptic force curves, 1px or 2px thick |

The **cut corner** is Quadra's signature: boxes, cards, keycaps and buttons all lose their
four corner pixels. Use `cut` and `frame_box` rather than plain rectangles for anything that
reads as an object.

Inactive full-colour icons are dimmed with `brightness`, not tinted grey.

## 5. Text

- The font is **Silkscreen** (OFL), rasterised without anti-aliasing by
  `tools/gen_silkscreen_font.py` into `src/fonts/`. Scale 1 is a 10px font (caps 7px), a
  classic 5×7 console face; scales 2, 3 and 4 are the 8px font doubled, tripled and
  quadrupled.
- Text is **upper case**.
- Use `fit_scale()` to pick the largest scale that fits a width. Alignment uses the ink
  bounds, so centred text is optically centred.
- Labels are GREY, values WHITE, a focused or edited value AMBER. Small captions under a
  label carry the engineering name (`SNAP` / `KP`).
- Short words beat long ones: the ring and the status bar have very little room. `--` means
  "not used here".

## 6. 1-bit sprites

A sprite is a width, a height and a string of `w × h` characters, row after row: `#` is a
set pixel, anything else is empty. They live in `src/ui_gfx.cpp`:

```c
const Sprite SPR_SHAPE_M = {11, 6,
    ".........##" "........###" ".......###." ".....####.." "#######...." "#####......"};
```

- Draw them at the size they will be shown. Most screen icons exist at 1× and as a
  hand-drawn 1.5× (`_M`) version.
- Strokes are 1px at 1×; at 1.5× use 2px where a 1px line would look thin next to the
  other icons.
- Declare new sprites in `ui_gfx.hpp` and add them to the size check in
  `tools/ui_preview/preview.cpp`, which fails if a string has the wrong length.

## 7. App icons

Each app profile has a 24×24 icon (status bar, lists) and a 48×48 icon (profile screen, idle
screen). They are the only full-colour art.

1. **Draw them by hand as pixel art** at exactly 24×24 and 48×48, as PNGs in
   `tools/icons/<app>_pixel_24.png` and `<app>_pixel_48.png`. Draw each size separately;
   don't scale one from the other. Few colours, hard edges, transparent background. No
   anti-aliased edges and no gradients.
2. **Convert them** with `tools/gen_icon_c.py`, which writes RGB565 big-endian C arrays to
   `src/app_profiles/icons/`. It does not resample: what you drew is what the device shows.
   Pixels under 50% alpha become black, which the display treats as transparent.
3. The 48×48 icon also sets the app's **accent colours** unless the profile names its own
   `plasma_heat`. Check the idle screen and the LEDs after changing an icon.

Uploaded icons (the companion's IMPORT IMAGE, `tools/send_icon.py`) are the exception to
"hand-drawn": they are fitted from any picture. Built-in profiles always use drawn icons.

## 8. Command cards

A command card is the 120×64 animated illustration of what a command does. It is a **scene
description** in the profile's C file (or its JSON), never an image. `src/ui_cards.cpp`
draws it.

- A scene is an optional `base` (drawn under every frame) and a list of **keyframes**. Each
  keyframe has a duration in ms and a handful of elements. The card cuts from one keyframe
  to the next with no tweening, loops, and holds the last one.
- Elements (`app_profile.h`, `EL_*` macros): `EL_BOX` and `EL_FRAME` (cut-corner boxes),
  `EL_DASH` (a group), `EL_DISC`, `EL_SEL` (selection with handles), `EL_LABEL`, `EL_LINE`,
  `EL_ROW` (a layers / outliner / feature-list row), `EL_ISO` and `EL_ISO_FILLET`
  (isometric boxes), `EL_MODES` (Plasticity's selection modes), `EL_ARC` / `EL_ELLIPSE`,
  `EL_NUM`, `EL_ROLLBACK`, `EL_CLIPBOARD`, `EL_PLAY`.
- Colours are the palette's: `K_D` dark, `K_G` grey, `K_W` white, `K_A` amber, `K_B`
  black.
- Show the **result** of the command in two to four keyframes, the way the app itself would
  show it: before, the action (amber marks what changes), after.
- Keep to the layout of the app's existing cards: Figma cards are a mini canvas plus a layers
  panel; Plasticity and Onshape cards are an isometric viewport plus the outliner or the
  feature list.

## 9. Animation

- Every animation is a **pure function of elapsed time**: given `t_ms`, draw the frame. No
  state carried between frames, no frame counters. `src/ui_fx.cpp` (the loading screen and
  the idle routines) and the FEEL / SHAPE / STEPS animations in `src/ui_screens.cpp` are the
  examples to copy.
- Positions are rounded to whole pixels before drawing. Squash and stretch scale nearest
  neighbour.
- Motion has weight: ease in and out (`ease_out3` in `display_task.cpp`), overshoot, squash,
  shake, dust. Avoid linear sliding except for scrolling content.
- Effects (sparks, rings, sparkles) use the palette or the app's accent colours, as single
  pixels or small blocks.
- The display only draws while something changes. If your screen animates, tell
  `display_task.cpp` to keep drawing while it is shown (the `looping` condition in
  `update_ui()`).

## 10. The companion app

The companion (`companion/`) uses the same visual language on a desktop.

- **Colours:** `C` in `companion/src/ui/kit.ts`, the same palette.
- **Type:** Silkscreen, at sizes on its 4px grid (16, 24, 32, 48 px), upper case.
- **Pixel drawing:** small `<canvas>` elements drawn at 1× with `fillRect` only, then scaled
  up by CSS with `image-rendering: pixelated`. Curves, dials and sparklines follow the
  device's own drawing code (`waveY` mirrors `wave_y`).
- **Cards and buttons:** 1px frames with the corner pixels cut (the `--cut` clip-path in
  `style.css`), like `frame_box` on the device. Amber marks focus, the selected card and
  unsaved values.
- **The device view** (`companion/src/assets/device.png`) is a rendered photo of the
  hardware and is the one non-pixel image. Its screen, LED glow and key states are drawn on
  top of it.
- When the device gets a new screen or setting, the companion shows it the same way: same
  names, same order, same muted `--`.

## 11. Screenshots for the docs

- **Device screens** come from the preview tool, never from photos:
  `tools/ui_preview/run.sh out.png` builds the real UI code for the host and renders every
  screen into a contact sheet, printing the tile names in order. Each doc image is one tile:
  the 480×480 (2×) circle, with transparent corners, saved to `docs/images/`. To add one,
  add a `keep("name")` tile to `tools/ui_preview/preview.cpp`.
- **Companion screenshots** come from demo mode in Chrome at 960×640 with a device scale of
  2 (1920×1280 PNG): `pnpm dev`, then `http://localhost:1420/?demo&tab=HAPTICS` (or
  `PROFILES`, `DEVICE`, `SYS_INFO`; `&edit=1` opens the editor). They live in
  `companion/docs/`.
- **Illustrations** in the docs (`companion/docs/fig-*.svg`) are hand-written SVG in the same
  palette, on black, with a monospace font: the same look, for diagrams.
- After any UI change, re-render the screenshots it affects in the same change.

## 12. Checklist

Before committing anything visual:

- [ ] Only the five palette colours (plus an app's own icon and accents where they belong).
- [ ] No anti-aliasing, blending, gradients, sub-pixel positions or smooth scaling.
- [ ] Drawn from code or scene data; no new bitmaps except hand-drawn app icons.
- [ ] Sprites and icons drawn at the size they are shown; 1.5× versions hand-drawn.
- [ ] Text upper case, in Silkscreen, sized with `fit_scale` where space is tight.
- [ ] Animations are functions of `t_ms`, rounded to whole pixels.
- [ ] Everything stays inside the round glass.
- [ ] `tools/ui_preview/run.sh` builds and the new screen looks right in the contact sheet.
- [ ] The companion shows the same thing the same way, if it shows it at all.
- [ ] Affected screenshots re-rendered.
