**A haptic knob for creative software, by Kafi Devices.**

Quadra is a desktop controller built around one motorised knob, four keys and a round
240×240 display. The motor can make the knob feel like anything: crisp detents, a smooth
sine bump, syrup-like drag, or a hard wall at the end of a list. The firmware uses that to
drive applications directly. In Figma the knob zooms, walks the layer tree and runs a wheel
of auto-layout and component commands. In Plasticity and Onshape it orbits, pans and zooms
the viewport, and it dials fillets, extrusions and rotations to exact values. It is also a
volume dial with the album cover on screen, a desk clock, and a console for AI coding agents
that shows their requests and lets you approve one by holding a key.

Every screen in this README is rendered by the firmware's own drawing code through the host
preview tool (`NanoDepsidf/tools/ui_preview`), so what you see is exactly what the display
shows, at 2× scale.

## Features

- **Programmable haptics.** Field-oriented control of a BLDC motor at 10 kHz, with three
  force laws:
  - **SAW:** crisp detents with an electrical click pulse.
  - **SINE:** a smooth bump.
  - **VISCOSE:** pure velocity damping, no detents.

  Five **haptic profiles** package a feel: WIDE, COARSE, MEDIUM and FINE (8 to 36 detents
  per turn, SAW or SINE) and SMOOTH (VISCOSE). Each keeps its own stiffness (Kp), damping
  (Kd), SHAPE, click volume and pitch, tunable live within safe limits. Modes, app inputs
  and parameter steps each use one. Lists end in a **haptic wall**: the knob pushes back
  instead of clicking past the end.
- **Audible clicks.** Every detent plays a synthesised click through an I²S amplifier and
  transducer, at the pitch and amplitude of the haptic profile in use, so a fine step sounds
  different from a coarse one. Two timbres exist (WOOD, THUD); choosing one is hidden from
  the menu for now, and the saved one plays.
- **USB composite device:**
  - a keyboard, mouse, gamepad and media-key HID interface;
  - a vendor HID data channel, used by the desktop companion and for icon upload;
  - a CDC serial console.

  Nothing has to be installed: the computer sees a keyboard and a mouse. The optional
  [desktop companion](#desktop-companion) edits settings and profiles.
- **APP mode with app profiles.** Each supported application is one data file describing
  what the knob and keys send, how the knob feels while doing it, and what the screen shows.
  MUSIC, AGENTS, CLOCK, Figma, Plasticity and Onshape ship today. Any profile can be edited,
  or a new one made, from the companion; edited profiles and macros are stored on the device.
  Blender and AutoCAD are listed as empty profiles (the knob scrolls) until they are designed.
- **MUSIC.** The knob is the computer's volume and the keys play, pause and skip, as media
  keys the system handles itself. With the optional Mac service running, the screen shows
  the album cover, title and artist, and a volume ring that moves with the knob.
- **AGENTS.** Claude Code, Codex and Cursor can show their permission requests on the knob,
  through the optional Mac service and its hooks. Hold F1 to allow, F3 to deny. A dashboard
  shows which sessions are working or waiting, and a command wheel types their commands.
- **CLOCK.** The time in up to five zones, with daylight saving, set from the Mac or from
  the internet over WiFi.
- **WiFi.** The knob can join a network and talk to the companion app without a cable, over
  an encrypted link that is paired over USB.
- **Command wheel.** Hold a key, turn to pick a command, release to run it. Each command has
  a small animated illustration of what it does.
- **Parameter mode.** After a modelling command starts, the knob sets its value: fine clicks,
  or exact 0.05 / 0.10 / 1.00 steps. In Plasticity you can constrain to the X, Y or Z axis;
  in Onshape the knob steps the dialog's number field 0.01 / 0.1 / 1.0 at a time. Then
  confirm or cancel.
- **Pixel UI.** A console-style interface on a round display: crisp whole-pixel graphics, a
  pixel font, and animated transitions. Screen rotation is selectable for holding the device
  in any orientation.
- **Idle screen.** Arcade attract mode: the active app's icon (or the QUADRA wordmark, or a
  word of your own) jumps around or explodes onto the screen with squash and stretch, dust,
  debris and sparkles, in that app's colours. A routine is picked at random each time.
- **LEDs in the app's colours.** A 60-LED ring around the knob and two LEDs under each key:
  a dim gradient at rest, a spot that follows the knob and pulses on every detent, the
  command wheel's segments, a flash at an end stop. The colour, effect and brightness can
  be changed in LIGHTS.
- **Icon upload.** Send any 48×48 image over USB to show on the main screen (RAM only).

## First calibration

> ⚠️ **Before using a new or erased device.** The motor has to learn how the magnetic
> sensor lines up with its coils. Until it has, the knob has no haptics. Calibration runs
> once, by itself, and takes about two seconds, but **the knob must be free to turn while it
> runs.**

### How to run it

1. **Place the device on the desk with nothing touching the knob.** Don't hold, press or
   rest a finger on it.
2. **Plug in USB.** Keep your hands off the keys; some key combinations held at power-on
   start other modes (see below).
3. **Wait about 8 seconds.** The firmware waits 3 s, then watches the keys for 3 s, then
   calibrates. During calibration:
   - the knob **snaps to a position** and holds it for about 1 s (alignment);
   - then it **makes a small, visible step** (direction check).
4. **Turn the knob.** Crisp detents mean it worked. The result is saved in flash (NVS,
   namespace `foc_cal`) and reused on every later boot, so it never runs again on its own.

If the knob stays limp with no detents, calibration was rejected, usually because the knob
was held and didn't move during the step. Nothing is saved in that case. Unplug, keep your
hands off, and plug in again to retry.

With a serial monitor attached (`pio device monitor`), a good run logs
`calibration OK: direction=±1, offset=…` then `calibration saved to NVS`. A failed one logs
`rotor didn't move during step`.

### When to calibrate again

Only after a **hardware change**: the magnet, the sensor, the motor or its wiring was
removed, moved or replaced. Firmware updates don't need it; the saved calibration survives
reflashing. The knob-direction setting (`KNOB_DIRECTION`) is unrelated to calibration.

### How to force a new calibration

- **From the menu: DEVICE → RECALIBRATE.** The easiest way.
  1. Open the menu (F4, or hold F4 in APP mode), go to **DEVICE → RECALIBRATE** and press
     **F1**. The button fills amber and asks you to take your hands off the knob.
  2. Press **F1 again** to start (F3 or turning the knob cancels). The motor switches off,
     the saved calibration is forgotten and the device restarts.
  3. It then calibrates exactly like a first boot (the knob twitches briefly), saves the
     result and goes straight back to normal use. No replug needed.
- **F1 + F2 at power-on (diagnostic mode).**
  1. Hold **F1 and F2**, plug in USB, and keep holding for at least 6 s.
  2. The device calibrates afresh, ignoring the saved result, and saves the new one.
  3. It then runs a **bench test**: the knob moves by itself through 30 positions, about
     1.5 s each (about 45 s in all). Keep your hands off.
  4. **Unplug and plug in again** to return to normal use with the new calibration.
- **Erase the flash** (`pio run -t erase`, then flash again). The next boot is a first boot
  and calibrates as above. This also **resets every saved setting** (haptics, profiles,
  display, boot mode).

Other key combinations held at power-on:
- **F3 + F4** is the USB recovery mode (see [Building and flashing](#building-and-flashing)).
- **F1 alone** runs the same bench test with the saved calibration. **F1 + F3** and
  **F1 + F4** start further motor diagnostics. None of these are needed
  for normal use; if you start one by mistake, unplug and plug in again.

## Using Quadra

### Keys and knob

The four keys are **F1, F2, F3 and F4**, from left to right along the bottom of the display.
The screen always shows what each key does, on the key legend at the bottom.

| Input | Main screen, non-APP modes | In the menu |
|---|---|---|
| Knob | Mouse scroll wheel, one step per detent | Move the selection / change a value |
| F1 | — | Select, or start / confirm an edit |
| F2 | — | Save the current screen |
| F3 | — | Back / cancel an edit |
| F4 | Open the menu | Close the menu |

In APP mode the keys belong to the application (see below), and **holding F4 for 0.7 s
opens the menu** instead.

</p>

| Screen | Settings |
|---|---|
| **PROFILES** | APP, KEYBOARD, MOUSE or MIDI. With APP, F1 opens **PROFILE**, a carousel of the installed app profiles. With KEYBOARD or MOUSE, F1 moves to **HAPTIC**, the haptic profile the knob uses in that mode. With MIDI, F1 moves to the channel. |
| **HAPTICS** | STEPS picks a haptic profile: WIDE, COARSE, MEDIUM or FINE (8, 12, 24 or 36 detents per turn) or SMOOTH (no steps). Each profile keeps its own FEEL (SAW or SINE; SMOOTH is always VISCOSE), SNAP (Kp), DAMP (Kd), SHAPE (how late and steep SAW's pull rises), AMP and PITCH, within safe limits for that profile and feel. An item that doesn't apply in the current feel shows `--`. Changes are live while you tune; F2 saves; holding F2 for 1.5 s puts the shown profile back to factory. |
| **DISPLAY** | ROTATION: 0°, 90°, 180° or 270°. The screen turns live while you turn the knob. |
| **LIGHTS** | The LED look. COLOR: APP (the profile's colours, or the album cover's while music plays) or CUSTOM, with HUE and SAT. EFFECT at rest: GRADIENT, SOLID, BREATHE, SPIN, RAINBOW or OFF, with SPEED for the moving ones. LEVEL: brightness, 10–200% of the standard level. The screen's rim mirrors the ring while you tune. |
| **BOOT MODE** | USB MODE: HID (the normal composite device) or SERIAL (for flashing). Applies after a restart. |
| **DEVICE** | **SYS INFO**: live readings on five pages, turn to move between them, F1 resets the peaks and counters. POWER: estimated draw (motor, LEDs, board) against what the USB-C / PD chip negotiated at boot. HEAT: chip temperature, motor coil current and heat. CPU: load per core, control-loop rate, spikes per second, worst compute time, jitter, missed ticks. LOOP: where one control iteration's time goes (input, sensor, force, motor), plus sensor CRC errors. SYSTEM: free RAM, dropped HID reports, audio gaps, uptime. **BINDINGS**: MAC or PC. Profiles are written with Mac shortcuts; on PC every Cmd is sent as Ctrl (Option is Alt on both). Switches as you turn, F2 saves. **RECALIBRATE**: F1, then F1 again, restarts and recalibrates the motor (see [First calibration](#first-calibration)). |

Screens with a single choice (PROFILES, DISPLAY, BOOT MODE, BINDINGS) change the value directly as you
turn. LIGHTS, like HAPTICS, is live while you tune and kept by F2. Leaving without F2 puts the saved value back. Saved settings live in NVS flash and
survive power cycles.

### APP mode and profiles

APP is the default HID type. The status bar shows the active app's icon and name, and the
keys and knob drive that application. Profiles are chosen in **PROFILES → PROFILE**, in this
order: MUSIC, AGENTS, CLOCK, Plasticity, Figma, Onshape, Blender, AutoCAD. A new or erased
device starts on MUSIC.

The knob's feel follows what it is doing: each input uses a haptic profile. Smooth drags
(orbit, pan, zoom) use SMOOTH. Stepped actions (undo history, layers, frames, the command
wheel) use the stepped profile nearest to their step count, so retuning that profile on the
Haptics screen changes them too.

### Figma

<p>
  <img src="NanoDepsidf/docs/images/main-figma.png" width="200" alt="Figma main screen">
  <img src="NanoDepsidf/docs/images/figma-wheel-align.png" width="200" alt="Figma wheel: ALIGN LEFT">
  <img src="NanoDepsidf/docs/images/figma-wheel-detach.png" width="200" alt="Figma wheel: DETACH INSTANCE">
  <img src="NanoDepsidf/docs/images/wheel-echo.png" width="200" alt="Main screen echoing a command after it ran">
</p>

| Input | Tap | Hold + turn |
|---|---|---|
| Knob alone | — | Zoom (⌘ + wheel) |
| F1 | Undo | Undo / redo, one history step per detent |
| F2 | Zoom to selection | **Depth:** clockwise selects children (↵), counter-clockwise the parent (⇧↵) |
| F3 | — | **Command wheel** |
| F4 | Long press: menu | Next / previous frame (N / ⇧N) |

**Wheel rings (F3):**
- **STRUCTURE:** add or remove auto layout, wrap in frame, group.
- **ALIGN:** left, centre, right, top, middle, bottom, tidy up.
- **COMPONENTS:** create component, detach instance, go to main component, reset instance.
- **UTILITY:** copy and paste properties, rename, run last plugin.

Commands without a shortcut go through Figma's Actions search (⌘K, type, Enter).

Shortcuts assume macOS and a US keyboard layout.

### Plasticity

<p>
  <img src="NanoDepsidf/docs/images/plasticity-orbit.png" width="200" alt="Plasticity main screen: isometric pyramid while orbiting">
  <img src="NanoDepsidf/docs/images/plasticity-wheel-fillet.png" width="200" alt="Plasticity wheel: FILLET">
  <img src="NanoDepsidf/docs/images/plasticity-wheel-boolean.png" width="200" alt="Plasticity wheel: BOOLEAN">
  <img src="NanoDepsidf/docs/images/plasticity-wheel-edges.png" width="200" alt="Plasticity wheel: EDGES selection mode">
</p>

| Input | Tap | Hold + turn |
|---|---|---|
| Knob alone | — | Zoom (continuous: Ctrl + middle-drag) |
| F1 | — | Zoom |
| F2 | — | Orbit (middle-drag) |
| F3 | Undo (⌘Z) | **Command wheel** |
| F4 | Long press: menu | Pan (right-drag) |

The main screen shows a small isometric pyramid chained to the knob. It turns one-for-one
with orbit, zooms through nested copies, slides with pan, and flashes on undo. After an
orbit it settles to the clean 45° isometric pose.

**Wheel rings (F3):**
- **SOLID:** extrude, fillet, boolean, cut, offset face, hollow.
- **EDIT:** move, rotate, scale, duplicate, mirror, delete.
- **SELECT:** control points, edges, faces, solids, all types, select all, invert.
- **VIEW:** front, right, top, perspective, focus, isolate, unisolate.

Keys follow Plasticity's defaults from the [Plasticity manual](https://doc.plasticity.xyz/all-commands).
Commands without a default key use the command palette (F, type, Enter).

### Onshape

<p>
  <img src="NanoDepsidf/docs/images/profile-onshape.png" width="200" alt="App profile carousel on ONSHAPE">
  <img src="NanoDepsidf/docs/images/onshape-wheel-revolve.png" width="200" alt="Onshape wheel: REVOLVE">
  <img src="NanoDepsidf/docs/images/onshape-wheel-circle.png" width="200" alt="Onshape wheel: sketch CIRCLE">
  <img src="NanoDepsidf/docs/images/onshape-wheel-section.png" width="200" alt="Onshape wheel: SECTION view">
</p>

Onshape runs in the browser, so keys land only while its tab has focus. Navigation follows
Onshape's default mouse: right-drag rotates, middle-drag pans, and the scroll wheel zooms.

| Input | Tap | Hold + turn |
|---|---|---|
| Knob alone | — | Zoom, one scroll notch per detent |
| F1 | — | Zoom |
| F2 | — | Orbit (right-drag) |
| F3 | Undo (⌘Z) | **Command wheel** |
| F4 | Long press: menu | Pan (middle-drag) |

The main screen shows the same knob-driven isometric shape as Plasticity, as a cube.

**Wheel rings (F3):**
- **MODEL:** sketch, extrude, revolve, fillet, chamfer, shell.
- **MODIFY:** boolean, split, transform, linear pattern, mirror, move face.
- **SKETCH:** line, rectangle, circle, arc, dimension, trim, construction. These are
  Onshape's single-letter sketch keys, which work only while a sketch is open.
- **VIEW:** front, right, top, isometric, normal to, zoom to fit, section.

Cards show Onshape's feature list on the right, with the new feature above the rollback
bar. Keys follow Onshape's
[keyboard shortcuts](https://cad.onshape.com/help/Content/Home/keyboard_shortcuts_and_hotkeys.htm).
Tools without a default key go through tool search (⌥C, type, Enter).

### Blender and AutoCAD

<p>
  <img src="NanoDepsidf/docs/images/profile-blender.png" width="200" alt="App profile carousel on BLENDER">
  <img src="NanoDepsidf/docs/images/profile-autocad.png" width="200" alt="App profile carousel on AUTOCAD">
</p>

Both are in the profile list with their icons, but not designed yet: they use the **empty
template**. The knob scrolls as it does outside APP mode, F1–F3 do nothing, and holding F4
opens the menu. Their own controls will come in later profiles; both work differently from
the Plasticity / Onshape pair.

### MUSIC

<p>
  <img src="NanoDepsidf/docs/images/profile-music.png" width="200" alt="App profile carousel on MUSIC, the first of eight">
  <img src="NanoDepsidf/docs/images/music-playing.png" width="200" alt="MUSIC now playing: the album cover full screen, title and artist">
  <img src="NanoDepsidf/docs/images/music-volume.png" width="200" alt="MUSIC: turning the knob, a volume ring and the number 42 over the cover">
</p>

The knob is the computer's volume, and the keys are the player's. Everything is sent as media
keys, which the system handles itself: no app needs focus, and nothing has to be installed.

| Input | Does |
|---|---|
| Knob | Volume, one step per click on the FINE haptic profile. On a Mac each click is a quarter step (Shift + Option + volume), 64 steps from silent to full |
| F1 | Play / pause |
| F2 | Previous track |
| F3 | Next track |
| F4 | Long press: menu |

With **BINDINGS** on PC the knob sends plain volume keys.

**Now playing** needs the optional [Mac service](#the-mac-service). It reads what the Mac is
playing (any player that shows in Control Center: Music, Spotify, a browser tab, Kaset) and
sends it to the knob:
- **Cover:** shown full screen, darkened under the title and artist. A track with no
  artwork gets the iTunes Store's cover if the title and artist match, otherwise a generated
  placeholder.
- **Volume ring:** while you turn, a ring and the number show the volume, on the screen and on
  the LED ring at once. The ring moves on the click, before the Mac answers.
- **Player glyph and colours:** a key press shows a play, pause or skip glyph, and **PAUSED**
  marks a stopped track. The LEDs take the cover's colours, unless LIGHTS is set to CUSTOM.

While music plays, the cover stays up instead of the idle animation. Without the service,
the keys and knob work the same and the screen shows the MUSIC icon.

### AGENTS

<p>
  <img src="NanoDepsidf/docs/images/notify-agents.png" width="200" alt="Claude Code asks to RUN a command; three agents waiting, one arc each round the rim">
  <img src="NanoDepsidf/docs/images/notify-hold.png" width="200" alt="Holding F1 to allow an EDIT: a green arc fills the rim">
  <img src="NanoDepsidf/docs/images/agents-board.png" width="200" alt="AGENTS dashboard: three sessions, WORKING, YOUR TURN and ASKING">
  <img src="NanoDepsidf/docs/images/agents-wheel-clear.png" width="200" alt="AGENTS command wheel: CLEAR, drawn as a terminal typing /clear">
</p>

A console for AI coding agents: Claude Code, Codex and Cursor.

| Input | Tap | Hold + turn |
|---|---|---|
| Knob alone | — | Scroll |
| F1 | Enter | **Command wheel**: rings for Claude Code, Codex and Cursor (slash commands and shortcuts; F1, F2 and F3 jump between the rings) |
| F2 | Esc | Prompt history (↑ / ↓) |
| F3 | Shift + Tab (the agent's mode) | — |
| F4 | Long press: menu | — |

Commands that type text never press Enter, so you check a command before sending it.

**Requests on the knob.** With the [Mac service](#the-mac-service) installed, an agent's
permission request appears on the knob in any profile, with the menu closed:
- **The card:** the agent's badge and colour, and what it wants to do (the command, or the
  file it wants to edit). The ring breathes in the agent's colour.
- **Several agents waiting:** the ring and the screen's rim split into one arc per agent, up
  to four.
- **Nudge:** while a request waits, the knob gives a gentle double tap every 5 s.

| Key | Answer |
|---|---|
| Hold **F1** for 0.7 s | **Allow** (a green arc fills the rim) |
| **F3** | **Deny** |
| **F2** or **F4** | **Later**: answer in the agent's own window |

Only the knob's own F1 allows. A key pressed from the companion app can deny or defer, but
never allow. If the knob doesn't answer within 30 s, or isn't there, the agent asks in its
own window as usual; the service never decides on its own. "Your turn" and "needs input"
notices also show, and any key dismisses them. The knob and the keys keep their normal jobs
while a request is up; only the key you answer with is held back from the app.

**Dashboard.** In the AGENTS profile the main screen lists the running agent sessions by
project folder, with their state: WORKING, YOUR TURN, ASKING or IDLE.

### CLOCK

<p>
  <img src="NanoDepsidf/docs/images/clock.png" width="200" alt="CLOCK: TOKYO UTC+9, 14:07 with seconds, the date, a dot per zone and a seconds ring">
</p>

The time in up to five zones: **LOCAL** (the computer's) and four more of your choice, each
with its own daylight-saving rules.

| Input | Does |
|---|---|
| Knob | Next / previous zone |
| F1 | 12 / 24 hours |
| F2 | Seconds on / off |
| F3 | Date on / off |
| F4 | Long press: menu |

The knob learns the time from the [Mac service](#the-mac-service), which sends the time and
the local zone every few minutes, or from the internet when [WiFi](#wifi) is on. Zones and
the format are set in the companion app (**LOOK → CLOCK**) or with `quadra.py clock`. LED
SECONDS turns the ring into a seconds hand. The clock never goes to the idle screen.

### The Mac service

`NanoDepsidf/tools/mac/` is an optional background service for macOS. It powers MUSIC's now
playing, the AGENTS requests and dashboard, and CLOCK's local time. It talks to the knob
over USB.

```sh
python3 -m pip install --user hidapi Pillow
python3 NanoDepsidf/tools/mac/install.py             # install or update
python3 NanoDepsidf/tools/mac/install.py --dry-run   # show what would change
python3 NanoDepsidf/tools/mac/install.py --uninstall # take it all out again
```

The installer:
- copies the service to `~/.quadra/` and runs it as a LaunchAgent (`com.quadra.daemon`,
  log in `~/Library/Logs/quadrad.log`);
- builds a small Now Playing helper (needs the Xcode Command Line Tools; without it, Music and
  Spotify are read over AppleScript);
- adds hooks next to your existing ones in `~/.claude/settings.json`, `~/.codex/hooks.json`
  and `~/.cursor/hooks.json`. Each file is backed up first, and `--uninstall` removes exactly
  those hooks.

The hooks reach the service over a socket only your user can open. The service's only
internet traffic is for covers: it downloads artwork from the link the player gives, and when
a track has none, sends the artist and title to the iTunes Store's search. Settings are in
`~/.quadra/config.json`.

### The command wheel

Hold the wheel key (F3) and the screen turns into a carousel of commands:
- **One detent per command.** Clockwise moves to the next.
- **× at the start of every ring** cancels.
- **A haptic wall at both ends.**
- **Release to run** the command.
- **Opens on the last command you used,** so a quick hold-and-release repeats it.
- **Switching rings:** while the wheel is open, F1, F2 and F4 jump between rings. A key
  bound to two rings (F1 in every profile) steps through them.

Each command has a **card**: a 120×64 illustration of what it does, animated in a loop. In
Figma a card is a mini canvas plus layers panel. In Plasticity it is a wireframe isometric
viewport, the selection-mode strip and the outliner. In Onshape it is the same viewport
(or a flat sketch) beside the feature list. Cards are not stored as images. They are short
scene descriptions (shapes, rows and keyframes) drawn at runtime, so 71 animated cards cost
about 30 KB of flash in total. After a command runs, the main screen replays its
card for a moment with the name in amber.

On a key that also has a tap action (Plasticity's F3 = undo), the wheel only appears after
you hold it for 250 ms, so a quick undo never flashes it on screen.

### Parameter mode

<p>
  <img src="NanoDepsidf/docs/images/param-chamfer.png" width="200" alt="Parameter mode: chamfer">
  <img src="NanoDepsidf/docs/images/param-rotate.png" width="200" alt="Parameter mode: rotate 35 degrees about X">
  <img src="NanoDepsidf/docs/images/param-scale-cancel.png" width="200" alt="Parameter mode: scale, holding F3 towards cancel">
</p>

Running **fillet, extrude, offset face, hollow, move, rotate or scale** from the Plasticity
wheel turns the screen into that command's value dial. The card follows the value live.

| Input | Does |
|---|---|
| Knob alone | **Free:** fine clicks, on the FINE haptic profile. Each click nudges the value and moves the pointer, so Plasticity's own handle follows. |
| Hold F1 / F2 / F4 + turn | **Exact** steps of 0.05 / 0.10 / 1.00 (rotate: 1° / 5° / 15°), one click each, on the MEDIUM / COARSE / WIDE haptic profiles: the bigger the step, the wider the clicks. The value is typed in on confirm. |
| Tap F1 / F2 / F4 | Constrain to **X / Y / Z** (move, rotate, scale). Tap the active one again for its plane (⇧X…), and for scale again for uniform (S). |
| Tap F3 | Confirm |
| Hold F3 (0.6 s) | Cancel (Esc); a bar fills while you hold |

**Fillet:** turning right makes a fillet, turning left a chamfer. That is Plasticity's own
sign convention.

**Limits:** values with a minimum (hollow thickness, scale factor) stop at a haptic wall.

**Defaults:** move starts on X, rotate on Z, and scale is uniform. Each command remembers
the last constraint you used.

#### Onshape: the number field

<p>
  <img src="NanoDepsidf/docs/images/param-onshape-scroll.png" width="200" alt="Onshape parameter mode, A scroll: RADIUS +.30">
  <img src="NanoDepsidf/docs/images/param-onshape-type.png" width="200" alt="Onshape parameter mode, B type: DEPTH 26.00">
</p>

Running **extrude, fillet, chamfer, shell, move face or transform** from the Onshape wheel
opens the same dial. Onshape has no handle to drag, so the knob drives the dialog's number
field. That field steps 0.1 per scroll notch, 0.01 with Ctrl and 1.0 with Shift.

| Input | Does |
|---|---|
| Knob alone | Steps of **0.1**, one click each (MEDIUM haptic profile) |
| Hold F1 + turn | Steps of **0.01** (FINE haptic profile) |
| Hold F4 + turn | Steps of **1.0** (COARSE haptic profile) |
| Tap F2 | Switch between **A** and **B** (remembered) |
| Tap F3 | Confirm (Enter) |
| Hold F3 (0.6 s) | Cancel (Esc) |

The two ways the value reaches Onshape:
- **A, scroll (the default).** Point at the field. Each click is one scroll notch, with Ctrl
  or Shift held for the step, and Onshape updates its own preview. The device can't read the
  field, so the screen shows the change (+.30) and there are no limits.
- **B, type.** The device keeps the value. When the knob rests, it selects the field (⌘A)
  and types the value. The screen shows the value, with haptic walls at the limits.

### Idle screen

<p>
  <img src="NanoDepsidf/docs/images/idle-jump.gif" width="240" alt="JUMP, animated: the Onshape icon hops, makes a big jump, lands with dust and debris, hops sideways and spins">
  <img src="NanoDepsidf/docs/images/idle-boom.gif" width="240" alt="BOOM, animated: a pixel explosion, the Figma icon pops out, bobs with sparkles and implodes">
  <img src="NanoDepsidf/docs/images/idle-quadra.gif" width="240" alt="JUMP with the QUADRA wordmark, animated">
</p>

These animations are recorded from the firmware's own drawing code (JUMP with Onshape, BOOM
with Figma, JUMP with the QUADRA wordmark), at 20 fps; the device runs them at its full frame
rate.

After 5 s without input the screen goes into an arcade-style attract mode: the active app's
48×48 icon, or the QUADRA wordmark outside APP mode, performs a routine. While music plays
(MUSIC) or the clock is up (CLOCK), those stay on screen instead. The first is picked
at random every time the device goes idle, and when it finishes, a different one follows.

- **Jump.** Never leaves the screen: two small hops, a crouch and a big jump with
  afterimages, a hard landing (squash, screen shake, dust, debris), a gleam, hops left and
  right, a spinning jump, then it breathes with sparkles around it.
- **Boom.** A fuse blinks, a pixel explosion goes off (white core, a ring in the app's
  colours, smoke, debris, a hard shake), the icon pops out with a springy overshoot, bobs
  over its shadow with sparkles, then implodes into a flash.

A third routine, **Bounce** (the icon rattling around inside the glass like a pinball), is
built but switched off. Set `ROUTINE_ON[ATTRACT_BOUNCE]` to `true` in `src/ui_fx.cpp` to put
it back into the rotation.

Everything is whole pixels; squash and stretch scale the icon nearest-neighbour. Accents
(sparks, the explosion ring, sparkles) use the app's colours: Figma's purple, blue and
green, Onshape's teal, green and lime, and for other profiles the three most common colours
of the icon. QUADRA uses amber. Any input wakes the device, and the waking key press is
swallowed.

<p>
  <img src="NanoDepsidf/docs/images/idle-word.png" width="200" alt="The loading screen with the idle word HELLO in place of QUADRA">
</p>

**Your own word.** An idle word of up to 12 characters, set from the companion app (**LOOK →
IDLE WORD**) or with `quadra.py text`, replaces QUADRA on the loading screen and in the idle
animation. With an app icon up, the word and the icon take turns, one routine each.

### LEDs

A ring of 60 LEDs sits around the knob and two LEDs sit under each key. They take the same
three colours as the idle screen (the app's accents, amber outside APP mode and in the menu).
The standard level is 20% of full brightness; **LIGHTS → LEVEL** scales it from 10% to 200%
of that, and **LIGHTS** also sets a custom colour and a different effect at rest.

| When | Ring around the knob | Key LEDs |
|---|---|---|
| At rest | A dim gradient of the app's three colours | Dim, in the same gradient from F1 to F4; a key with no action is nearly off |
| Turning the knob | A bright spot follows the knob and pulses on every detent click; it fades back into the gradient about a second after the knob stops | — |
| Holding a key | — | That key lights up fully |
| Command wheel open | One segment per command (cancel first, dim white); the chosen one is bright | — |
| End stop | A short white flash of the whole ring | — |
| Menu | Amber | Amber |
| Idle | The gradient drifts slowly and dims | Dimmed |
| An agent's request | Breathes in the agent's colour; one arc per waiting agent; fills green while F1 is held | — |
| MUSIC, turning the knob | The volume, as an arc in the cover's colour | — |
| CLOCK with LED SECONDS | A seconds hand | — |

The animations are deliberately calm: 30 updates a second, and a strip is only sent again
when one of its LEDs changes. A software cap scales everything down if the estimated draw
would pass the LED budget: 250 mA on a USB-C port that offers 1.5 A or more, 100 mA on a
plain 500 mA port. With WiFi on, the radio's ~100 mA comes off that budget.

### WiFi

<p>
  <img src="companion/docs/app-device-wifi.png" width="440" alt="Companion app, DEVICE → WIFI: connected to STUDIO, the knob's address and quadra-7142.local">
</p>

WiFi is optional and off until you set it up, over USB: in the companion app (**DEVICE →
WIFI**) or with `quadra.py wifi --ssid NAME` (it asks for the password). The network name
and password are stored on the knob and never sent back out. Open, WPA2 and WPA3 networks
work.

Once connected:
- **Name:** the knob is `quadra-xxxx.local` on the network (mDNS).
- **Time:** it sets its clock from `pool.ntp.org`. This is the only connection it makes
  outside your network.
- **Companion:** the app reaches it without a cable. Pair it once over USB (**DEVICE →
  WIFI → PAIR THIS APP**): the knob gives the app a random 256-bit key.

**The encrypted link.** It runs on TCP port 3333:
- Each connection proves both sides hold the key, and every message is encrypted, so
  nothing else on the network can read, fake or replay it (HMAC-SHA256 handshake,
  AES-256-GCM).
- The network settings, the key, SERIAL boot and image uploads only change over USB.
- **NEW KEY** cuts off every paired app.

All of WiFi runs on Core 1, so the control loop keeps its timing.

## Firmware architecture

The firmware is ESP-IDF 6.1, built with PlatformIO. It is written in C for the real-time
and model code, and C++ for the display. This section is a summary; the full technical
description is in [`NanoDepsidf/docs/FIRMWARE.md`](NanoDepsidf/docs/FIRMWARE.md).

**Core split.** Core 0 runs only the control loop: FOC, sensor reads, haptics, key reads and
input mapping. Core 1 runs everything that can tolerate latency:

| Task | Core | Priority | Job |
|---|---|---|---|
| `control` | 0 | 20 | 10 kHz FOC + haptic loop, key debounce, menu input, APP-mode engine |
| `usb` | 1 | 12 | Brings the host in line with the wanted HID state every tick |
| TinyUSB device task | 1 | 11 | The USB stack itself (kept above the display so animations never delay reports) |
| `i2s` | 1 | 9 | Click synthesis and audio output |
| `display` | 1 | 9 | Renders frames into a full-screen sprite and pushes them over SPI |
| `led` | 1 | 10 | LED ring and key LEDs at 30 fps; above the display so its animations can't stall it, asleep between frames |
| `pd` | 1 | 10 | One-shot at boot: reads the STUSB4500's contract over I2C (read-only), then exits |
| `sysmon` | 1 | 10 | SYS INFO: samples load, loop timing, temperature and the power estimate twice a second; logs a line every 5 s |
| `menu_save` | 1 | 10 | Runs F2's save to flash, so it never happens inside a control-loop tick |
| `net_link` | 1 | 10 | The companion over WiFi: its socket, handshake and encryption |
| `net` | 1 | 5 | WiFi housekeeping: connecting, reconnecting, signal strength. The radio, lwIP and mDNS also run on Core 1 |

The ESP-IDF timer task and its interrupt are moved to Core 1 too (`sdkconfig.defaults`).
With WiFi in modem sleep they fire at every beacon, and on Core 0 they cost the control loop
missed ticks.

**Timing.** A hardware timer interrupt wakes the control task every 100 µs. One iteration takes
about 26 µs on average and 42 µs at worst, with 5 µs of jitter and no missed ticks (measured
on hardware through DEVICE → SYS INFO, WiFi off). With WiFi connected, the contributor
measured 49 µs at worst, 50 µs of worst-case jitter and no missed ticks. To get there, everything the loop runs sits in
internal RAM (IRAM) instead of flash: the loop's own functions, the FreeRTOS, SPI, PWM and GPIO
code it calls, and the C library's `sinf` / `cosf`. From flash, that code shared a cache with
Core 1 and stalled whenever Core 1 was busy. A write to flash (saving settings or a profile)
still pauses both cores briefly while the chip writes.

**Knob direction.** Which way counts as forward is one constant, `KNOB_DIRECTION` in
`control_task.c` (currently inverted, -1). It flips what a turn means everywhere (menu, APP
mode, the scroll wheel, end stops) while the motor and haptic maths stay in sensor
coordinates.

**Haptics.** Each tick reads the encoder and finds the nearest detent, with hysteresis. It
then applies the active haptic profile's law: a SAW spring with a click pulse, a SINE bump, or
VISCOSE damping. Fast flicks coast torque-free. End stops refuse the next detent and push
back without a jump in force.

**State, not events.** The control task never queues USB press/release events. It publishes
what the host *should* see: held buttons and modifier, pending pointer travel and wheel
steps, and a ring of key taps. The USB task keeps sending until the host matches, so a
report lost to a busy endpoint can never leave a key or button stuck down.

**App profiles are data.** `src/app_profiles/` holds one C file per application. A profile
declares:
- the slots (knob, F1–F4), each with an action (drag, wheel, keys, tap or command wheel), a
  feel and a detent count, which pick the haptic profile it uses;
- a quick-tap action per key;
- the command rings and their commands;
- each command's card, as scene data;
- optional parameter specs.

The engine (`src/app_mode.c`) knows nothing about any particular app.

**Rendering.** One 240×240 RGB565 sprite in internal RAM is fully redrawn and pushed with
LovyanGFX: about 1 ms to draw and 12 ms to push. Frames are produced only when something
changes, or while an animation runs. Everything is whole pixels, with no anti-aliasing:
- a black background with a four-colour palette (white, grey, dark, amber), where app icons
  are the only full-colour exception;
- a Silkscreen-derived pixel font;
- 1-bit sprites, sometimes scaled by whole numbers.

---

## Building and flashing

**Requirements:** [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) (CLI or the VS Code extension). The
ESP-IDF, TinyUSB and LovyanGFX dependencies download on the first build.

```sh
cd NanoDepsidf
pio run                                        # build
pio run -t upload --upload-port <port>         # flash
pio device monitor                             # serial console, 115200 baud
```

In normal operation the device enumerates as a composite HID + CDC device, and uploads use
the CDC port's 1200-baud reset. If an upload can't find the device:

- **Hold F3 + F4 while powering on.** For that boot, the device skips the HID device and
  stays in the ESP32-S3's plain USB serial/JTAG mode, which the uploader can always reach.
  This takes priority over every saved setting.
- Or set **BOOT MODE → USB MODE → SERIAL** in the menu and restart.
- Or let `quadra.py flash` do it: it asks the knob over USB to restart in SERIAL mode,
  flashes, and waits for it to come back. No keys needed.

The board definition is `NanoDepsidf/boards/nanofoc_d.json`, and the partition table
`boards/nano_partitions.csv` has two OTA slots of 1.625 MiB each, NVS and a 640 KiB data
partition that holds stored profiles.

> ⚠️ **Updating from firmware before WiFi.** The partition table changed: the app slots
> grew and the profile store moved and shrank. Flash the new table along with the firmware.
> The clean way is `quadra.py flash --partitions .pio/build/esp32-s3-devkitm-1/partitions.bin`
> (see [Tools](#tools)), which also blanks the new profile store. `pio run -t upload` writes the table too, and the
> store formats itself on the first boot. App profiles stored or uploaded from the companion
> are lost, so export any you made first. Settings, calibration and haptic profiles live in
> NVS, which didn't move, and are kept. Motor calibration runs on first boot and is cached in NVS; see
[First calibration](#first-calibration) before the first use of a new or erased board.

---

## Tools

All Python tools use one virtualenv:

```sh
python3 -m venv NanoDepsidf/tools/.venv
NanoDepsidf/tools/.venv/bin/pip install -r NanoDepsidf/tools/requirements.txt
NanoDepsidf/tools/.venv/bin/python NanoDepsidf/tools/quadra.py hello   # for example
```

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `tools/ui_preview/run.sh [out.png]` | Compiles the firmware's UI code for the host against a small graphics stub and renders every screen into one PNG contact sheet: menus, wheels, every command card, parameter dials, the idle screen. No hardware needed. |
| `tools/profile_json_test/run.sh` | Builds the profile JSON code for the host and checks it: every built-in profile survives a round trip unchanged, and bad input is refused with a reason. |
| `tools/send_icon.py` | Uploads a 48×48 image to the device over the vendor HID interface (`icon.png`, `--test-pattern`, `--clear`, `--list`, `--dry-run --preview out.png`). |
| `tools/gen_icon_c.py` | Converts a PNG into an RGB565 C array for a profile icon (24×24 status bar, 48×48 profile screen and idle screen). |
| `tools/gen_silkscreen_font.py` | Regenerates the pixel fonts in `src/fonts/` from Silkscreen. |
| `tools/quadra.py` | The knob from the command line, over USB: `hello`, `profile [name]`, `text WORD` (idle word), `lights`, `clock`, `wifi`, `cover image.png`, `notify` (a test request), `reboot [--serial]`, `flash [firmware.bin] [--partitions table.bin]` (no keys needed), `loop` (the control loop's health) and `wifi-check` (tests the WiFi link's security against this knob). |
| `tools/mac/` | The optional [Mac service](#the-mac-service): now playing, agent requests, the local time. |
| `tools/tz_test/`, `tools/net_pend_test/` | Host checks for CLOCK's time-zone rules (against Python's zoneinfo) and for how the WiFi link queues handshakes. |

## Desktop companion

<p>
  <img src="companion/docs/app-haptics.png" width="440" alt="Companion app: the live device and the HAPTICS panel">
  <img src="companion/docs/app-sys-info.png" width="440" alt="Companion app: SYS INFO with power and heat">
</p>

`companion/` is a macOS app (Tauri, about 4 MB) that reads the knob live and changes its
settings from the computer, in the device's own pixel style:

- **The device:** a render of the knob, live: its own screen, the LED ring in the colours the
  LEDs show, and the keys as you press them. It is also a remote: click a key, or drag or
  scroll over the knob to turn it.
- **HAPTICS:** the haptic profiles (STEPS), and each one's FEEL and SNAP, DAMP, SHAPE, AMP
  and PITCH sliders, with a reset to factory.
- **PROFILES:** the mode, and the app profiles with their icons. Any profile can be edited:
  key labels, icon, what the knob and keys send, the command wheel and macros. New profiles
  can be made from scratch or by duplicating one.
- **LOOK:** the idle word, LIGHTS (colour, effect, brightness), and the CLOCK app's zones
  and format.
- **DEVICE:** BINDINGS, rotation, boot mode, WiFi and pairing, and the firmware version.
- **SYS INFO:** power, heat, CPU and system, with a minute of history.

Changes are live on the knob; **SAVE** stores them, just as F2 does. The same UI also runs as
a web page in Chrome or Edge over WebHID. It talks to the vendor HID interface with the small
protocol in `src/host_proto.h` and its extensions in `src/ext_proto.h`, so it needs no driver.
Once paired, the app also reaches the knob over [WiFi](#wifi).

```sh
cd companion && pnpm install
pnpm tauri dev                 # the app
pnpm dev                       # the page (open http://localhost:1420; add ?demo for a simulated knob)
pnpm tauri build               # Quadra.app
```

Every screen is covered in the [user guide](companion/docs/COMPANION.md). Building, WebHID and
notarizing are covered in [`companion/README.md`](companion/README.md).

## Writing an app profile

1. **Add the file.** Create `src/app_profiles/<app>.c` defining a `const app_profile_t`, and
   add one line to the registry in `app_profiles.c`. No build changes are needed; `src/` is
   globbed. The quickest start is the empty template, which gives a working profile where the
   knob scrolls and holding F4 opens the menu (as `blender.c` and `autocad.c` do today):

   ```c
   const app_profile_t app_profile_blender =
       APP_PROFILE_EMPTY_ICON("blender", "BLENDER", app_icon_blender_24, app_icon_blender_48);
   ```

   `APP_PROFILE_EMPTY(id, name)` does the same with a placeholder icon.

   The registry checks each profile once before use (version, names, legends, slots, rings,
   commands, scenes). A profile that fails, or a missing entry, is replaced by the same empty
   template, shown as EMPTY, so a mistake can never crash the device.
2. **Add icons.** Draw a 24×24 and a 48×48 icon (`tools/icons/<app>_pixel_{24,48}.png`) and
   convert them with `gen_icon_c.py`.
3. **Fill in the slots.** A turn action is a drag (mouse buttons + modifier + pointer axis), a
   wheel, or keys (one shortcut per detent, clockwise and counter-clockwise). A key can also
   have a quick-press `tap`:

   ```c
   [APP_SLOT_F1] = {
       .kind = APP_ACT_KEYS, .label = "UNDO/REDO",
       .cw = {CMD | SHIFT, HID_KEY_Z}, .ccw = {CMD, HID_KEY_Z}, .tap = {CMD, HID_KEY_Z},
       .feel = HAPTIC_TYPE_SAW, .detents = 12,
   },
   ```

   `.feel` and `.detents` choose the input's haptic profile: VISCOSE uses SMOOTH, and a count
   uses the nearest of WIDE (8), COARSE (12), MEDIUM (24) and FINE (36).

4. **Optional: a command wheel.** Set a slot to `APP_ACT_COMMANDS` and define `rings`. Each
   command is a shortcut, or a phrase typed into the app's search (`.search`). It has a
   `scene` for its card: a list of keyframes, each a handful of elements such as
   `EL_BOX`, `EL_FRAME`, `EL_ROW` (outliner rows), `EL_ISO` (isometric boxes) or `EL_MODES`:

   ```c
   SCENE(SC_EXTRUDE,
         KEYFRAME(600, EL_ISO(32, 40, 16, 16, 0, APP_ISO_FACE), EL_MODES(M_FC), ...),
         KEYFRAME(1300, EL_ISO(32, 35, 16, 16, 14, APP_ISO_FACE), EL_MODES(M_FC), ...));
   ```

5. **Optional: parameter mode.** Give a command an `app_param_t` with its label, steps,
   limits, the key that puts the app into value entry, axis options and a visual. Set the
   profile's `param_keys`: numeric entry, confirm, cancel, the X / Y / Z keys and uniform.
   For an app with number fields instead of handles, set `.field = true` with the modifier
   for each step (`step_mod`), the scroll direction and a select-all key, as Onshape does.
6. **Check it.** Render with `tools/ui_preview/run.sh`; every card and dial shows up in the
   contact sheet.

`figma.c`, `plasticity.c` and `onshape.c` are complete worked examples.

## Status and roadmap

**Working and confirmed on hardware:**
- FOC and haptics, with end stops, and the five haptic profiles.
- Audio clicks.
- The USB composite device.
- The settings menu with persistence, display rotation, DEVICE → RECALIBRATE and
  DEVICE → BINDINGS (MAC / PC).
- APP mode with the Figma, Plasticity and Onshape profiles, their command wheels, and
  parameter mode (Plasticity's handle, Onshape's number field).
- The idle screen, icon upload, and the pixel UI.
- The LED ring and key LEDs, with the power budget taken from the USB port.
- The USB power reading and DEVICE → SYS INFO.
- A fast, steady control loop: 10.00 kHz, about 26 µs per iteration on average and 42 µs at
  worst of a 100 µs budget, 5 µs of jitter, no missed ticks and no spikes.
- The desktop companion for macOS: the live device view, settings, haptic profiles, SYS
  INFO, profile editing and upload, and macros stored on the device.

**Contributed and tested on the contributor's hardware, not yet confirmed on ours:**
- MUSIC with now playing, AGENTS with requests and the dashboard, CLOCK.
- WiFi and the companion over WiFi.
- LIGHTS, the idle word, and the companion's LOOK tab and remote.
- The Mac service, and flashing with `quadra.py flash`.

**Next:**
- Safe SNAP and DAMP limits for each haptic profile and feel (today they are the full
  ranges), and tuned values for each profile's second feel.
- A haptic-profile choice per app input in the companion's profile editor (today it follows
  the input's feel and step count).
- F4 quick tap in APP mode, and KEYBOARD / MOUSE as built-in profiles.
- Integration tests: the cross-core load test, and the loop's worst case during a save to
  flash.
- Real MIDI output (the MIDI mode stores a channel only).

**Later:**
- Automatic profile switching from the frontmost app.
- A Figma plugin for direct value control over HID.
- The companion on Windows.

**Known assumptions:**
- Shortcuts are written for **macOS**; on Windows set DEVICE → BINDINGS to PC (Cmd is sent
  as Ctrl). They assume a **US keyboard layout**: HID sends key positions, so other layouts
  can type different characters.
- Uploaded icons (`send_icon.py`) are held in RAM and cleared on restart; icons imported
  into a profile in the companion are stored with the profile.

## Credits

Quadra's firmware and companion are by Kafi Devices.

[**@Dviros**](https://github.com/Dviros) contributed, in
[pull request #17](https://github.com/katbinaris/NanoD_RatchetH1/pull/17):
- **MUSIC:** media keys, the now-playing cover and the volume ring.
- **AGENTS:** agent requests on the knob, the dashboard, the command wheel, and the hooks for
  Claude Code, Codex and Cursor.
- **CLOCK:** time zones with daylight saving, checked against Python's zoneinfo.
- **WiFi:** SNTP, mDNS, and the encrypted, USB-paired companion link.
- **LIGHTS and the idle word:** the LED look, and a word of your own on the idle screen.
- **The Mac service:** now playing, agent requests and the local time.
- **The companion:** the LOOK tab, WiFi, the MEDIA input, and the live screen as a remote.
- **Tools and fixes:** `quadra.py`, buttonless flashing, moving the timer work off Core 0 so
  WiFi costs the control loop no ticks, and the LED ring's rotation fix.
